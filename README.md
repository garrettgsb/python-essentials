Python Essentials
Lighthouse Labs, April 2018

# Agenda

## Systems Check

* Does our Python work? (v3.6.5)
  - https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - Or if that doesn't fly: https://repl.it/ and search for "Python3"

* Does our text editor (Atom or whatever) work?
  - https://atom.io

* Do we have the git repo?
  - It would be odd if you were looking at this file and didn't have the repo, but...

### Project 1:
  Write a Python script that generates messages from a template, and
  from some basic info about a person.

### Project 2:
