Python Essentials
Lighthouse Labs, March 2018

# Agenda

## Systems Check

* Does our Python work?
* Does our text editor (Atom or whatever) work?
* Do we have the git repo?

## CSVs

* What does CSV stand for and why is that important?
* How to hand-craft a CSV file

## Python
* How do you read and write files?
* Variables and Data Types

```
coke = {
  types: ['Zero', 'Diet', 'Cherry', 'Vanilla', 'Ordinary'],
  sizes: ['1L', '335mL', '750mL'],
  sizesInMl[1000, 335, 750]
}
```

### Project 1:
  Write a Python script that hard-codes some columns and data for us
  * Conditionals (if `file${n}` exists, name the new file `file${n+1}`)
  * Iterating (looping) (Repeat this row a bunch of times)
  * String concatenation (For each permutation of coke types, )

### Project 2:
  Write a Python script (blank-slate.py) that creates a CSV file 100 columns wide and 100 rows long
